 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. It allows us to analyze and compare algorithms based on their performance characteristics. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity is low, implying that it can handle larger inputs in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
  <p><b>Space Complexity</b>, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the input size. It's often denoted using the big O notation, with 'O(n)' representing linear growth in memory usage. Managing space complexity is crucial to avoid excessive memory consumption. Optimizing both time and space complexity is a key challenge when designing efficient algorithms.</p>

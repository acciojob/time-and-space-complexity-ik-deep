	<h1> Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p><b>Time complexity</b> is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the <b>efficiency</b> of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the input size. It provides a way to analyze and compare algorithms based on their performance characteristics. A lower <b>time complexity</b> indicates a more efficient algorithm, as it implies that the algorithm will complete its task in a shorter amount of time for larger inputs. By understanding the time complexity of algorithms, developers can make informed decisions about which algorithm to use for a particular problem, aiming for solutions that strike a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> a fundamental concept in computer science, refers to the amount of memory or space an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the input size. It helps assess the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of memory utilization. <b>Space complexity</b> is often denoted using the big O notation, where O(n) represents a linear relationship between input size and memory usage. This implies that as the input size grows, the memory required by the algorithm also grows linearly. </p>

	<h1> Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the input size. </p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> a fundamental concept in computer science, refers to the amount of memory or space an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the input size. It helps assess the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of memory utilization. <b>Space complexity</b> is often denoted using the big O notation, where O(n) represents a linear relationship between input size and memory usage. This implies that as the input size grows, the memory required by the algorithm also grows linearly. </p>
